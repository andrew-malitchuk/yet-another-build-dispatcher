# YABD

## `:yabd`

### Structure

YABD follows a modular structure to ensure flexibility and maintainability.
The core functionality is divided into separate modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of
the build distribution process.

These modules include:



### Config

The configuration module in YABD is pivotal for customizing various aspects of the build distribution
process. Through carefully defined configurations, users can tailor YABD to suit their specific 
requirements and environments.


### Networking

YABD harnesses the capabilities of http4k, a lightweight HTTP toolkit for Kotlin, to handle
networking tasks effectively. This choice offers several benefits, including high performance, 
simplicity, and extensibility. Leveraging http4k allows YABD to effortlessly manage HTTP
communications, making it ideal for handling build distribution requests.

### Debug 

YABD provides robust support for debugging, offering developers the tools and capabilities necessary 
to identify and resolve issues efficiently throughout the build distribution process.
